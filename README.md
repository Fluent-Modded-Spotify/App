## Installation:

#### Windows:

* You can also build and install it yourself through [```autorunscript.ps1```](https://github.com/Fluent-Modded-Spotify/App/releases)

#### Linux:

* Download the two files from Releases
* Run ```autorunscript.sh``` to install all dependencies.
* Run ```Fluent Spotify.deb``` 

#### Arch Linux and its Derivatives

Follow the same process for Linux above, except the install scripts can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/windowz414/FMS-Arch)

Note: ```autorunscript.ps1```/```autorunscript.sh``` is a file which automatically installs the dependencies for this app (needs admin priviledges to work)
