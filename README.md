## Installation

#### Windows:

- Download the two files from Releases
- Copy them to a folder in an easily accessible location like Desktop
- Install ```scoop``` using ```iwr -useb get.scoop.sh | iex```
- After scoop is installed, type ```Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted``` in Powershell with elevated privileges
- Run Spotify.exe as admin (it's a 7z archive and requires admin to extract the files for some reason)
- Run ```autorunscript.ps1``` to install all dependencies
- Extract it to the same location
- Run ```Fluent Spotify.exe``` 
- Install it however you want, for all users/for the current user only
- After installing, go to the ```Spotify``` folder you just extracted and run ```Spotify.exe```
- You should have Fluent Design in the Spotify app now!

#### Linux:

* Download the two files from Releases
* Run ```autorunscript.sh``` to install all dependencies.
* Run ```Fluent Spotify.deb``` 

#### Arch Linux and its Derivatives

Follow the same process for Linux above, except the install scripts can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/windowz414/FMS-Arch)

Note: ```autorunscript.ps1```/```autorunscript.sh``` is a file which automatically installs the dependencies for this app (needs admin priviledges to work)
